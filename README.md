# Fullstack Open

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the applicationâ€™s data amongst other things.
